- Retrieve the briefs of 9 experiments from Zwaan et al. (2017)

|Category|Task|Description|Reference
|---|---|---|---|
|Perception|Simon task|Choice-reaction time task that measures spatial compatibility. Responses are faster when a visual target (a red square is presented on the left of the screen) is spatially compatible with the response (pressing the left button) than when the target is spatially incompatible with the response (presented on the right of the screen).|Craft & Simon, (1970).|
|Perception|Flanker task|Inhibition response task in which relevant information is selected and inappropriate responses in a certain context are suppressed. Responses are faster for congruent trials in which compatible distractors flank a central target (AAAAA) than for incongruent trials in which incompatible distractors flank a central target (AAEAA).|Eriksen & Eriksen, (1974).| 
|Perception|Motor priming|Implicit memory task with a priming procedure in which responses to stimuli (arrow probes <<) are required that are primed by presented compatible (<<) or incompatible (>>) items. Responses are slower for compatible items when primes are masked but faster when primes are visible.|Forster & Davis, (1984).|
|Memory| Spacing effect|Learning task in which learning (of words) is spaced over time. Recall of words is higher for spaced item repetitions with intervening items than for massed items immediately repeated after their first presentation.|Greene, (1989).|
|Memory|False memories|Memory task that assesses false memory of recognition performance of items that have not been presented before in a word list but tend to be recognized as presented before because they are semantically related to the words in the list.|Roediger & McDermott, (1995).|
|Memory|Serial position|Memory task that examines recall probability based on a word’s position in a list. Recall is higher for the first and last words in the list and lowest for items in the middle of the list.|Murdock Jr., (1962)|
|Language|Associative priming|Implicit memory task which requires a response to a target word that is preceded by prime word. Responses are faster when the prime is related than when the prime is unrelated.|Meyer & Schvaneveldt, (1971).|
|Language|Repetition priming|Implicit memory task in which speed of response depends on previous exposure to an item and the word frequency of that item. Responses are faster for repeated than for new items. This repetition effect is larger for low frequency words than high frequency words.| Forster & Davis, (1984).| 
|Language|Shape simulation|Sentence-verification task that requires a response on whether the object in a picture was present in the previous sentence. Yes responses are faster when the picture matches the implied shape mentioned in sentence than when it mismatches.|Zwaan et al., (2002).|
