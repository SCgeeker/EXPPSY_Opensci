  abstract = {The term psi denotes anomalous processes of information or energy transfer that are currently unexplained in terms of known physical or biological mechanisms. Two variants of psi are precognition (conscious cognitive awareness) and premonition (affective apprehension) of a future event that could not otherwise be anticipated through any known inferential process. Precognition and premonition are themselves special cases of a more general phenomenon: the anomalous retroactive influence of some future event on an individual's current responses, whether those responses are conscious or nonconscious, cognitive or affective. This article reports 9 experiments, involving more than 1,000 participants, that test for retroactive influence by "time-reversing" well-established psychological effects so that the individual's responses are obtained before the putatively causal stimulus events occur. Data are presented for 4 time-reversed effects: precognitive approach to erotic stimuli and precognitive avoidance of negative stimuli; retroactive priming; retroactive habituation; and retroactive facilitation of recall. The mean effect size (d) in psi performance across all 9 experiments was 0.22, and all but one of the experiments yielded statistically significant results. The individual-difference variable of stimulus seeking, a component of extraversion, was significantly correlated with psi performance in 5 of the experiments, with participants who scored above the midpoint on a scale of stimulus seeking achieving a mean effect size of 0.43. Skepticism about psi, issues of replication, and theories of psi are also discussed.},

  abstract = {We examined the prediction that people activate perceptual symbols during language comprehension. Subjects read sentences describing an animal or object in a certain location. The shape of the object or animal changed as a function of its location (e.g., eagle in the sky, eagle in a nest). However, this change was only implied by the sentences. After reading a sentence, subjects were presented with a line drawing of the object in question. They judged whether the object had been mentioned in the sentence (Experiment 1) or simply named the object (Experiment 2). In both cases, responses were faster when the pictured object's shape matched the shape implied by the sentence than when there was a mismatch. These results support the hypothesis that perceptual symbols are routinely activated in language comprehension.},

In Exp 1, Ss studied lists of 12 words (e.g., bed, rest, awake); each list was composed of associates of 1 nonpresented word (e.g., sleep). On immediate free recall tests, the nonpresented associates were recalled 40\% of the time and were later recognized with high confidence. In Exp 2, a false recall rate of 55\% was obtained with an expanded set of lists, and on a later recognition test, Ss produced false alarms to these items at a rate comparable to the hit rate. The act of recall enhanced later remembering of both studied and nonstudied material. The results reveal a powerful illusion of memory: People remember events that never happened.

  abstract = {Six experiments investigated repetition priming and frequency attenuation in lexical access with 164 college students. Repetition priming effects in lexical decision tasks are stronger for low-frequency words than for high-frequency words. This frequency attenuation effect creates problems for frequency-ordered search models that assume a relatively stable frequency effect. It was posited that frequency attenuation is a product of the involvement of the episodic memory system in the lexical decision process. This hypothesis was supported by the demonstration of constant repetition effects for high- and low-frequency words when the priming stimulus was masked; the masking was assumed to minimize the influence of any possible episodic trace of the prime. It was further shown that long-term repetition effects were much less reliable when the S was not required to make a lexical decision response to the prime. When a response was required, the expected frequency attenuation effect was restored. It is concluded that normal repetition effects consist of 2 components: a very brief lexical effect that is independent of frequency and a long-term episodic effect that is sensitive to frequency.

Using an anonymous elicitation format supplemented by incentives for honest reporting, we surveyed over 2,000 psychologists about their involvement in questionable research practices. The impact of truth-telling incentives on self-admissions of questionable research practices was positive, and this impact was greater for practices that respondents judged to be less defensible. Combining three different estimation methods, we found that the percentage of respondents who have engaged in questionable practices was surprisingly high. This finding suggests that some questionable practices may constitute the prevailing research norm.},

The results of this study confirmed our prediction that posing in high-power nonverbal displays (as opposed to low-power nonverbal displays) would cause neuroendocrine and behavioral changes for both male and female participants: High-power posers experienced elevations in testosterone, decreases in cortisol, and increased feelings of power and tolerance for risk; low-power posers exhibited the opposite pattern. In short, posing in displays of power caused advantaged and adaptive psychological, physiological, and behavioral changes, and these findings suggest that embodiment extends beyond mere thinking and feeling, to physiology and subsequent behavioral choices. That a person can, by assuming two simple 1-min poses, embody power and instantly become more powerful has real-world, actionable implications.},

至少在西元前240年，或許在更早的西元前466年，哈雷彗星返回內太陽系就已經被天文學家觀測和記錄到。在中國、巴比倫、和中世紀的歐洲都有這顆彗星出現的清楚紀錄，但是當時並不知道這是同一顆彗星的再出現。英國人愛德蒙$\cdot$哈雷最先使用開普勒第三定律估算出他的週期，1758-1759年彗星再次来临的时候，這顆彗星被命名为哈雷彗星，以纪念哈雷的工作。哈雷彗星上一次回歸是在1986年，而下一次回歸將在2061年。
1986年哈雷彗星回歸時，人类第一次用太空船詳細觀察彗星，得到了第一手的彗核結構與彗髮和彗尾形成機制的資料。這些觀測支持一些彗星結構的假設，如弗雷德$\cdot$惠普的「髒雪球」模型比较正確地预测了哈雷彗星是揮發性冰\textemdash\textemdash{}水、二氧化碳、和氨－和宇宙塵埃的混合物。資料使科学家建立了更准确的模型；例如，哈雷彗星的表面大部分是宇宙塵埃，沒有揮發性物質，並且只有一小部分是冰。},

  abstract = {引力透镜效應（gravitational lensing），根據廣義相對論，就是當背景光源发出的光在引力场（比如星系、星系團及黑洞）附近經過時，光线會像通過透鏡一樣發生彎曲。光线弯曲的程度主要取决于引力场的强弱。分析背景光源的扭曲，可以帮助研究中间作為``透镜''的引力场的性质。根据尺度与效果的不同，引力透镜效应可以分为强引力透镜效应和弱引力透镜效应。
一般从数学上来讲，面质量密度（
  
    
      
        $\kappa$
      
    
    \{$\backslash$displaystyle $\backslash$kappa \}
  ）大于1的为强引力透镜区域，小于1的为弱引力透镜区域。在强透镜区域一般可以形成多个背景源的像，甚至圆弧（又称``爱因斯坦环''，Einstein Ring），而弱透镜区域则只产生比较小的扭曲。强透镜方法通过对爱因斯坦环的曲率和多个像的位置的分析，可以估计测量透镜天体质量。弱透镜方法通过对大量背景源像的统计分析，可以估算大尺度范围天体质量分布，并被认为是现在宇宙学中最好的测量暗物质的方法。
1980年，天文学家观测到类星体Q0957+561发出的光在它前方的一个星系的引力作用下弯曲，形成了两个一模一样的类星体的像。这是人类第一次观察到引力透镜效应。},
