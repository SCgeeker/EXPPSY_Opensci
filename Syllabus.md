## Course Title: Open & Reproducible Science in Cognitive Psychology

### Course Description
This course aims to provide a comprehensive understanding of open and reproducible science practices in the context of cognitive psychology. It will also delve into the impact of participant nonnaiveté on the reproducibility of cognitive psychology experiments.

### Learning Objectives

1. Understand the principles of open and reproducible science.
2. Understand the concept of participant nonnaiveté and its impact on the reproducibility of cognitive psychology experiments.
3. Apply open and reproducible science practices in cognitive psychology research.
4. Develop skills for conducting reproducible research and managing participant nonnaiveté.

### Course Materials

Course materials will be provided via the FORRT resources page and additional readings from the "Participant Nonnaiveté and the reproducibility of cognitive psychology" paper.
